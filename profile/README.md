## 📦 Repositories

### [`@bacnet-js/client`](https://github.com/bacnet-js/client)

> 🧠 Low-level BACnet protocol implementation in TypeScript

A robust TypeScript library for encoding and decoding BACnet packets. This is the core engine of the ecosystem, enabling direct communication with BACnet-compatible devices. Fully tested and ideal for custom BACnet integrations.

### [`@bacnet-js/device`](https://github.com/bacnet-js/device)

> 🛠️ Virtual BACnet devices made easy

Create and simulate BACnet devices in Node.js for development, testing, or network emulation. Built on top of `@bacnet-js/client`, this module allows you to spin up virtual BACnet devices with ease. Also written in TypeScript and fully covered by test suites.
